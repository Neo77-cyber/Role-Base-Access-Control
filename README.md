# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) App


## Overview

This Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) App is a powerful access control system that enables administrators to define roles and permissions for users, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and perform certain actions within the application. RBAC is a fundamental security mechanism for managing access to different parts of your application.

## Features

- **User Roles**: Define different roles such as admin, moderator, and client.

- **Permissions**: Assign permissions to roles to specify what actions users in each role can perform.

- **Access Control**: Control access to specific routes, APIs, or features based on user roles and permissions.

- **User Management**: Add, edit, and delete users with specific roles and permissions.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT (for authentication)
- Docker (for containerization)
